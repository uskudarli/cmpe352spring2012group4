I am having my Master's degree in CmpE and had my B.S. degree in Bilkent University Mathematics department. I like drawing, short stories, smoking waterpipe in BeyazÄ±t and watching movies(oldies mostly).

I am more interested in theoretical fields in computer science but also OK with coding etc. Currently working in a Tubitak project about matrix and tensor factorizations and trying to do some useful math for the project(not in an advanced manner obviously).

I don't have a facebook page, you can contact me via e-mail.
