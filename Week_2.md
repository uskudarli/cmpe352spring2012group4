**Summary**

  * We did some more research on functional/non-functional requirements and how to distinguish them.

  * We analyzed a couple of examples before beginning to our requirements analysis.

  * We focused on non-functional requirements altogether.

  * We did brainstorming on the functionality of our application. (What to include, what not to include)

  * We divided the work of functional requirements after specifying the main points.

**Decisions**

  * Each person is responsible for 1-2 points. (Responsibilities are stated in "Requirements Analysis version1" document in "Downloads" section.)

  * Everybody will do their responsibility until 10pm today, then we will edit the page to obtain a formal & complete document.

  * Everybody will participate the doodle poll to decide on our weekly meeting on a day other than Monday.
