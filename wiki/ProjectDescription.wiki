=CMPE COMMUNITY=

==Project Description==

We will create a social web application to create an environment, where CMPE community can express and discover matters of interest -- academic or otherwise. This place will evolve into an archive of useful information.

Our application support the following:

• Member profiles

• Creation of a space for special interests (such as music, sports, multi agent systems, ruby, facebook apps, traveling, movies, science fiction, conferences....).

• Special purpsose structures for the area of interest must be created (i.e. traveling: where, when, duration, pictures)

• Discussion forum

• Surveys

• Subscription to areas of interests and forums

• Search/Advanced search

• Browsing

• Notification from subscriptions

A mobile application to interact with community will be supported.

Registration will be validated since it is a restricted community.
