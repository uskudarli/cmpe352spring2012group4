  * [http://www.academia.edu/ academia.edu] is similar to our project. It is *not belonging to* a specific university or a department *as opposed to* our project description (i.e _"... *CMPE* community can express..."_). There are many universities all over the world.

In this social network site, each member have *Answers* and *Questions* sections on their profiles. Like creating a new forum ,you can ask questions about a specific topic to the other people , and the people interested in this question can *answer* or *follow the question*. By following the question ,you can easily reach the possible answers may be given in the future. Besides ,you can see the *past questions* and *answers related to this topic*.

*One defective feature* we realize in the *signup process* is that it *does not check to validate* user's real identity. We used a hotmail account with *fake name and surname* to sign up and the site *did not complain*. If the site targets the *academic people*, it can use e-mail accounts with *.edu* extension in the *signup process*.

  * [https://www.yammer.com/ Yammer] - an *enterprise social network service* used for private communication within organizations or between organizational members and pre-designated groups.

It is similar to our project since a company email address *must be validated* in order to register the website. It is also similar in the way that it *supports android and smartphone* usage.

  * [http://www.researchgate.net/ Researchgate.net] - Network dedicated to science and research where it is possible to connect, collaborate and discover scientific publications, jobs and conferences

The project is similar to ours; however, interests are restricted to *scientific topics.*

This site is very similar to the site that we are going to create. Every member has his or her *profile*. While creating their own profile, everyone emphasizes their own interests. In this site the interests are limited to the academic topics so that all of the members are researchers teachers and students. On the other hand, in our web site social interests are included too. So this is one of the disadvantages of this site. 

[http://www.researchgate.net/ Researchgate.net] allows its members to create *groups* according to your interest. In this site members can also subscribe to some topics so that they are informed anything new via email. 

*Searching* in this site is also good organized. However you must decide the topic you want to search in after you search. So advanced search is not efficient.

Interface of this site is good designed. It is both good designed and simple. *Usibility* of the site is very high.

One of the most important disadvantages of this site is that there does not exist not only a *mobile application* but also mobile version of this site. Therefore, usibility of this site in a mobile phone is very low.

  * [http://www.deviantart.com/ deviantART] - The largest online social network for artists and art enthusiasts

With over 19 million registered members, attracts 45 million unique visitors per month. DeviantART is a platform that allows emerging and established artists to exhibit, promote, and share their works within a peer community dedicated to the arts. The site's vibrant social network environment receives over 100,000 daily uploads of original art works ranging from traditional media, such as painting and sculpture, to digital art, pixel art, films and anime.

Creating groups according to the topics that are chosen by users makes the webpage very effective. Users can join the groups they are interested in and they can receive instant messages from them, therefore, users are not disturbed with unnecessary notifications. 
Furthermore, users have some categories according to their role in the site. It can be used in our project to distinguish the students, teachers etc. 
The site has a very sophisticated user profile, as in our project users' interests are the focus of the site.

They use the APIs; OAuth 2.0, Sta.sh, User, oEmbed, RSS

  * [http://www.couchsurfing.org/ CouchSurfing] - Worldwide network for making connections between travelers and the local communities they visit

This project can be taken as an example while building the search section of our application. *Searching filters* in this site are very clear and convenient. Although there are about 3 million users on this platform, it is possible to make an efficient search to filter this number for a particular purpose.

  * [http://www.linkedin.com/ LinkedIn] - Business and professional networking

Linkedin is a widely used platform (with around 120 million members) which is similar to our project, because it can also be considered academic. There is a "jobs" section on this site. Since CMPE gathers people from the same department, *job opportunities* and announcements can be shared within this section if we add it as a requirement in our project.

  * [https://csc.cdf.toronto.edu/bb/YaBB.pl This] is the forum of undergraduate students of University of Toronto Computer Science department. It might give us an idea about what to focus on considering we are building a CmpE-specific website.
