[http://www.academia.edu/ academia.edu] is similar to our project. It is *not belonging to* a specific university or a department as opposed to our project description (i.e _"... *CMPE* community can express..."_). There are many universities all over the world.

*One defective feature* I realize in the *signup process* is that it *does not check to validate* my real identity. I used my hotmail account with *fake name and surname* to sign up and the site *did not complain*. If the site targets the *academic people*, it can use e-mail accounts with *.edu* extension in the *signup process*.
