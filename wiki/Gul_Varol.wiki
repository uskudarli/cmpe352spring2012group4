= Introduction =

I am a third year computer engineering student, happy to be present at this department. Having spent Fall2011 semester in Ecole Centrale Paris as an exchange student, I am trying to adapt back to the busy educational schedule in Bogazici.

Traveling, playing piano, foreign languages and dancing salsa are some of my hobbies which I cannot quit during my entire life. Besides traveling myself, I enjoy guiding guests touristically in a city that I know quiet well. Until now, those are Izmir, Istanbul and Paris.

I hate when people lie and worry too much. I believe negative thoughts bring negative situations. I feel sick when I hear talking about blood, illnesses etc.

I have accounts on many social media sites such as facebook, twitter, couchsurfing, tripping, tumblr, linkedin... You can contact me via those, but I prefer keeping most of my information private.
