After our long meeting on 18.12.2012, the decisions made are as follows:

<h4>The last modifications with the implementation will be made <font color="red">until 21.12.2012</font></h4>

These will be for

  * Settings (it is not functional yet)

  * Surveys (some missing features)

  * Discussion posts (controller missing)
 
  * Activity feed (dependency problem will be solved)

  * Password creation after login with Facebook

  * Messages module problem (a user cannot view other users at the moment)

<h4>Each person will create a test plan for his/her own module until 21.12.2012. An example is sent by e-mail. The same format will be followed. A [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqbdI1pXJ8GFdFVDeTlFSm1mc2NVVWxzUV90VWxEekE spreadsheet] which can be edited by every team members is shared.</h4>

<h4>Each person will make a code review.</h4>

<h4>Next week (24-31.12.2012), we will request several people to use our system and fill in the test documents. We will watch a few of them to observe which difficulties they encounter.</h4>
