   Studies computer engineering as a junior.She has never thought to be a computer engineer and unfortunately she still doesn't. She wants to work in a job that she doesn't code, is more interested in design or marketing. 
   Planning to see whole world until 35 and needles to say that she loves travelling. Likes dancing, taking photos and going out with her friends. Hates stingy, priggish people and nerds. 
   Wishes world peace, a motorcycle and no assignments.
