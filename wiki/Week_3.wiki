*Summary*

  * We did some research on "Use Case Diagrams", "Use Case Specifications", "Scenarios".

  * We found some examples.

  * We discussed for hours to decide on how to include interests in our program.

  * We listed the main use cases which should be present in order to create the scenarios we are given.

  * We wrote the steps for each of the use cases.

  * We started drawing the use case diagram.

  * We shared the rest of the work.

*Decisions*

  *  (result: we will have a common interest structure for which the creator of the interest will enter the "search tags" and the "category tags")

  * Each person is responsible for detailing two use cases.

  * Tuncay, Başak and Gül are responsible for updating the requirements analysis regarding the feedback.

  * Hakan is responsible for writing the scenarios.

  * Gül is responsible for finalizing the use case diagram.

  * From now on, we will have our weekly meetings at 5pm on Fridays.
