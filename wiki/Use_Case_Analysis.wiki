  * User enters his name, surname, e-mail and a password.

  * The e-mail entered does not contain the symbol “@”.

  * System checks e-mail validity and asks the user to enter a valid e-mail address.

  * User retries now with a valid e-mail address.

  * Admin checks the membership availability and accepts the user as a CMPE community member.

  * User creates an interest page by entering the name “making old style kites”, adds the category tags “arts”, “kite flying”, “old fashion” and adds the search tags as “old”, “kite”, “making kites”.

  * On the user’s homepage, another interest “Gramophone” appears as an interest recommendation because it has the similar category tags “arts” and “old fashion” as well as the common “old” search tag.

  * On the user’s homepage, another profile appears as a person recommendation because he has some common interests with him including “making old style kites”.
